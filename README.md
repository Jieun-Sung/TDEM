# TDEM
We introduce TDEM (Target-
induced Differential Expression Matrix), a novel computational framework that generates in silico target-perturbed
expression profiles from drug-induced transcriptomic data. TDEM circumvents experimental noise by learning target
representations computationally rather than relying on confounded genetic perturbation data.
